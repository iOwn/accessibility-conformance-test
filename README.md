# Accessibility Conformance Test
This is a test process recommendation for validating conformance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 
## Background
This project has the understanding that every web application will eventually unavoidably propose obstacles to their users - as users are highly individual in their needs. That said *being accessible* for a web application is a matter of the underlying criteria that define *accessibility*. A common set of criteria is being proposed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The follow up question would be how to check and validate for compliance with WCAG.
A compliance validation process is being proposed that provides testing/validation procedures for each WCAG success criterion. To test for all WCAG success criteria three testing modes have been identified which are advised to be run subsequently:
1. Automatic testing
2. Manual testing - mouse/keyboard
3. Manual testing - screenreader
For automatic testing, a common testing framework with a comprehensive and clear relationship to WCAG success criteria is being recommended.
For the manual testing modes, test prerequisites (some tests need a special setup) and test steps are being provided to check if the tested application complies with WCAG success criteria.
