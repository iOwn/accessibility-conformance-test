Listed are the conformance criteria (in this case WCAG) that define the understanding of accessibility. WCAG is considered a common standard. 
To comply with these criteria at least one of the testing procedures under the aforementioned methods (automatic or manual) has to exhaustively proof conformance. For each criterium the corresponding procedures for the methods `AVT-1`,`AVT-2` and `AVT-3` are listed in their respective column.
