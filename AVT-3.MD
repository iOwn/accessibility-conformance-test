| AVT-3-2 | When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined. | wcag-1-3-2 | :white_check_mark: `Required` |
| AVT-3-3 | Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. | wcag-1-3-3 | :white_check_mark: `Required` |
| AVT-3-4 | In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of User Interface Components, icons, and regions can be programmatically determined.	 | wcag-1-3-6 |  :white_circle: `Increased` |
| AVT-3-5 | The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. | wcag-2-4-4 | :white_check_mark: `Required` |

| AVT-3-9 | In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.	 | wcag-4-1-3 | :white_check_mark: `Required` |
